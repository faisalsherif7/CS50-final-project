        RATIB is a Zakat Calculator / Tracker for monthly salaries.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Zakat is an Islamic financial term. As one of the pillars of the faith, it requires all Muslims to 
        donate a portion of their wealth to charity. Muslims must meet a certain threshold before they can 
        qualify for zakat. The amount is 2.5% or 1/40 of an individual's total savings and wealth. Zakat can 
        be paid at any time during the lunar year.
    </p>
    <p>
        Muslims should take inventory of their possessions and wealth. Once they reach nisab or the threshold, 
        which is the value of 87.48 grams of gold or 612.36 grams of silver, they must pay zakat. The total amount 
        to be paid is 2.5% or 1/40 of their total savings and wealth. Muslims can use any number of zakat calculators 
        which are available online to determine their obligations.
    </p>
    <p>
        As for calculating zakat for monthly salary, most scholars recommend calculating it at the end of one lunar year
        for ease of calculations. However, there is a more accurate method for calculating the exact amount, as mentioned
        in the <a href="/guide">fatwa</a> by Shaykh Ibn Baz.
    </p>
    <p>
        RATIB is designed to make this calculation of zakat on monthly salary easier for its users. Check out our 
        <a href="/guide">user guide</a> for more information on how RATIB works.
